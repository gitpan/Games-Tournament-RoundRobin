Games-RoundRobin-Tournament version 0.02

Round-Robin Tournament Schedule Pairings

This module implements an algorithm that allows the setting up of round robin
tournaments, a form of competition where all members play in all the rounds and
every member meets every other member once and only once over the course of the
tournament.

This is a completely perl module. There is a dependency on Module::Build.

This is version 0.02, the second version uploaded to CPAN.

INSTALLATION

The installation depended on Module::Build, rather than ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
Now you can try the Makefile.PL, if you don't want to install
Module::Build.

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

or  perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Perhaps instead of make, you will use nmake or dmake.
